# '''
# first step:
# pre-train the coarse model (i.e.𝐸𝑐) for two epochs with a batch size of 64,
# with 𝜆𝑙𝑚𝑘=1𝑒−4, 𝜆𝑒𝑦𝑒=1.0, 𝜆𝜷=1𝑒−4, and 𝜆𝝍=1𝑒−4

# Why:
# training with only lmk loss for good initialization, 
# because the use of photometric loss needs good initialization both in regression and optimization
# and also, photometric loss needs differentiable rendering that makes the training slow
